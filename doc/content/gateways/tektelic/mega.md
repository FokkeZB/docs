## Provisioning on TTN Network Server

This application note outlines the procedure to provision a Kona Gateway on The Things Network (TTN) Network Server.

### 1.1 Required Equipment

- Computer running Windows XP/7/10
- Kona Micro/Macro/Mega Gateway
- Power source
- KonaFT software self-extracting installer
- Cat 5/5e/6 Network cable

### 1.2 Gateway Setup

 1. Connect the Ethernet ports of the gateway and computer as illustrated below.
 2. Copy the KonaFT self-extracting installer software onto the computer then double-click on the installer icon to start the installation process.
 3. Apply power to the Kona Gateway (refer to product specific user&#39;s guide).  Boot up time of the Gateway is approximately 2 minutes. During boot up, the LED status is Flashing Green.
 4. The Kona Gateway supports DHCP on the Ethernet port. The Gateway MAC address is printed on the Gateway label. Using KonaFT and the MAC address determine the IP address of the Gateway.
 - In KonaFT select **Tools** , then select **Find My Gateway** , then press **Scan**. When scanning is complete click then entry that corresponds to the Gateway&#39;s MAC address and press **Select**.
