* **Gateway EUI** - this is your Gateway ID that you obtained in the previous step. If you forgot, just type `gateway-version` in the command line. This must be the same with the LoRa Gateway's True Gateway ID otherwise you will fail to register your LoRa Gateway on TTN.
* Make sure to select the "I'm using the legacy packet forwarder" check box.
* **Description** - A human readable description of your LoRa Gateway.
* **Frequency Plan** - This is the frequency you want to use and it must be the same with LoRa Gateway and the LoRa Node.
* **Router** - The router this gateway will connect to. To reduce latency, pick a router that is in a region which is close to the location of the gateway.
* **Location** - Choose the location of the Gateway by entering its coordinates. This is reflected on the Gateway World Map!
* **Antenna Placement** - Where is your antenna placed? Is it placed indoors or outdoors?

Click **Register Gateway** and wait for a couple of minutes . If the status of your gateway is Connected, Congratulations! Your LoRa Gateway is now connected to the The Things Network (TTN).
