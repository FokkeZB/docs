## LoRa Basics Station

TTN supports the [LoRa Basics Station LNS protocol](https://doc.sm.tc/station/tcproto.html). LNS establishes a data connection between Basics Station and TTN, and is preferred over the legacy UDP Packet Forwarder.

Some of the advantages of Basics Station over the legacy UDP Packet Forwarder are:

- Centralized Update and Configuration Management
- TLS and Token-based Authentication
- Centralized Channel-Plan Management
- No Dependency on Local Time Keeping

## Connecting Your Device

To connect your device, use the following settings:

- Server Address: `wss://lns.{eu|us|in|au}.thethings.network:443`
- Server Certificate: see the [certificates section]({{< relref "../certificates" >}})

Check the **I'm using the legacy packet forwarder button** when registering your gateway in the console.

> NOTE: This is not the legacy packet forwarder, but internally this setting is correct.
