# Adding devices

To perform uplink and/or downlink communication between your end device and The Things Network, you first need to register/add your device on The Things Network. Devices are added within [applications]({{< ref "applications-and-integrations" >}}).

Registering your device can be done in two ways, via [Console](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/console/) or via [CLI](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/cli/installing-cli/).

Before adding your end device, make sure you know of which type your device is - ABP or OTAA. Depending on the type, some steps differ during the registration procedure. [Learn why using OTAA devices is recommended](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/abp-vs-otaa/).

## Adding a device using Console

If using the Console, you can add a device manually or using the [LoRaWAN Device Repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices/tree/master).

Manual registration is just a matter of providing some end device information like **MAC Version**, **PHY Version**, **Frequency Plan**, **DevEUI**, **JoinEUI**, etc. The required infomation depends on whether your end device is ABP or OTAA type. [See details about adding devices manually using the Console](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/adding-devices).

If your end device is a part of the [LoRaWAN Device Repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices/tree/master), registration of it will be semi-automated. This means that some features of the device are pre-defined, which helps you with the process of onboarding the device. If your end device is not present in this repository, you will have to add it manually.

> See [examples](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices/tree/master/vendor) of end devices added to the LoRaWAN Device Repository. Learn how to [add devices to the LoRaWAN Device Repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnwtEgw4f-c).

## Adding a device using CLI

To add a device using CLI, you need to have the CLI installed on your system. [Learn how to install and login with the CLI](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/cli/).

You can add both ABP and OTAA devices by manually providing the end device information through commands in your terminal. [See details about adding devices using the CLI](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/adding-devices).
