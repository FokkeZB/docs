To connect your gateway to The Things Network, it has to be configured to properly forward the traffic to it, and it also has to be added/registered on The Things Network.

> It is recommended to use <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/gateways/lora-basics-station/" target="_blank">LoRa Basics Station protocol</a>, due to number of security and scalability issues related to <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/gateways/semtech-udp-packet-forwarder/" target="_blank">UDP Packet Forwarder</a>.

Registering your gateway can be done in two ways, via <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/console/" target="_blank">Console</a> or via <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/cli/" target="_blank">CLI</a>. 

To add a gateway, you will need to provide **Gateway EUI** and its **Frequency Plan**. Some other optional parameters can be defined. <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/gateways/adding-gateways/" target="_blank">Learn how to add gateways using Console or CLI</a>.
