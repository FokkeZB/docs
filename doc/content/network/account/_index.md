The Account Server manages the applications, gateways, users and rights for The Things Network. The current V2 Account Server is closed source and hosted at `https://account.thethingsnetwork.org`. The future V3 Identity Server will be open source.

This guide will inform you about the [access]({{< relref "./authentication" >}}) and [use]({{< relref "./api" >}}) the Account Server API. In order to use the API, you need to [request a client ID]({{< relref "./clientid" >}}).

If you'd like to run the [open source backend](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/ttn) you can use the community Account Server, or [implement your own]({{< relref "./implement" >}}).
