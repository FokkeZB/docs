# Burning the Firmware

If the firmware version of your RAK811 WisNode LoRa Module is newer than V3.0.0.0 or you have just burned the bootloader into RAK811 according to the Burning Bootloader into the Device section, you just need to burn the upgrade firmware according to the following steps now:

1 . First, open and download the RAK Serial Port Tool [here](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/RAK811/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip). 

In case you have not just burned the bootloader, as instructed in the previous section you need to manually go into boot mode. Connect you board via the USB interface and enter the following AT command after you have connected via the proper COM port:
```
at+set_config=device:boot
```
