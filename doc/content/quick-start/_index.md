The Things Network offers a free and developer-friendly way to get familiar with LoRaWAN technology.

<!--more-->

The Things Network provides a public community LoRaWAN network, initiated by [The Things Industries](https://thethingsindustries.com/), and supported by 100k+ community members from more than 100 countries around the world.

> Join The Things Network [Forum](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/) or [Slack](https://ttn.fyi/slack-invite) for community support.

> For commercial solutions, we recommend using an SLA-backed network provided by The Things Industries. Learn more about [The Things Industries](https://thethingsindustries.com/).

> The Things Network runs on open source code, actively maintained by The Things Industries. If you would like to explore or contribute, visit our [open source LoRaWAN stack repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack).

> **Important note:** In 2021, The Things Network will be upgraded to use [**The Things Stack**]({{< relref "../the-things-stack" >}}), the third version of the LoRaWAN network stack. **The Things Network Stack** (version 2) will no longer be actively maintained. If you have been using The Things Network, you will need to learn how to [migrate your gateways and devices to The Things Stack]({{< relref "../the-things-stack/migrate-to-v3" >}}).

## Learn more about LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is a radio frequency protocol that allows devices to connect to the Internet over a long range with incredibly low power consumption. Visit our documentation to [learn more about LoRaWAN]({{< relref "../lorawan" >}}).

Watch the video below on *Everything you need to know about LoRaWAN in 60 minutes* by Johan Stokking (tech lead of The Things Network):

Read along to learn how you can implement your end-to-end IoT prototype within a day.

## Set up your LoRaWAN network

The main building blocks of The Things Network are **gateways**. Thousands of gateways across the globe are already connected to The Things Network, making the community LoRaWAN network available for a free usage. 

> See the [global coverage map](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/map)

Although you might already have coverage in your area, we still recommend you to get your hands on a gateway to ensure reliable coverage. There are a lot of gateways with extensive features on the market, so make sure you choose the one that fits your needs best. For example, here is a short list of some popular indoor gateways:

|   |  Gateway | Link  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| <img src="mikrotik_wap_l8.jpg" alt="Mikrotik wAP LR8" style="width:200px"/> | **Mikrotik wAP LR8** | [More info](https://mikrotik.com/product/wap_lr8_kit) |

Once you have your hands on a gateway, [learn how to connect your gateway to The Things Stack]({{< relref "../devices-and-gateways/adding-gateways" >}}).

> **Important note:** Different world regions use different [frequency plans](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/reference/frequency-plans/), e.g. 863-870 MHz for Europe, 902-928 MHz for North America, etc. Make sure you double check that the hardware aligns with your regionâ€™s radio frequency before purchasing!

## Get your development board and activate it

To build a prototype of your end-to-end IoT solution, you will need a development board. Here is a short list of popular development boards that can help you build your IoT app in no-time:

## Build your end-to-end application

Once you have your LoRaWAN network setup, you can use available integrations to build your end-to-end IoT solution. Integrations allow you to process data and act on it by triggering events. Learn [how to create integrations]({{< relref "../applications-and-integrations/" >}}).
