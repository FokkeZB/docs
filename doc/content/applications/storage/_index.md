The Storage Integration allows you to persist data in a database. The data is stored for seven days. You can then use the [API]({{< relref "api" >}}) to retrieve this data. Retrieving data will work as soon as the first data traffic happened after adding the integration.

* [Add the Integration]({{< relref "../integrations/#add-an-integration" >}})
* [Use the Integration]({{< relref "api" >}})
