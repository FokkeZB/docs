This guide will walk you through setting up the AWS IoT integration using CloudFormation: an easy process to configure one of the most advanced integrations for The Things Network.

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](http://console.aws.amazon.com)
2. Click on your region to create a new stack in that region: [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ **us-west-2**](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?filter=active&templateURL=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthethingsnetwork%2Fbuilds%2Fintegration-aws%2Fdist%2Fcloudformation.template&stackName=ttn-integration&param_AccountServer=https:%2F%2Faccount.thethingsnetwork.org&param_DiscoveryServer=discovery.thethings.network:1900&param_InstanceType=t2.micro&param_ThingShadowDeltaFPort=1&param_ThingSyncEnabled=true&param_ThingSyncInterval=10m&param_ThingTypeName=lorawan), [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º **eu-west-1**](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks/create/review?filter=active&templateURL=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthethingsnetwork%2Fbuilds%2Fintegration-aws%2Fdist%2Fcloudformation.template&stackName=ttn-integration&param_AccountServer=https:%2F%2Faccount.thethingsnetwork.org&param_DiscoveryServer=discovery.thethings.network:1900&param_InstanceType=t2.micro&param_ThingShadowDeltaFPort=1&param_ThingSyncEnabled=true&param_ThingSyncInterval=10m&param_ThingTypeName=lorawan), [ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ **ap-southeast-1**](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-southeast-1#/stacks/create/review?filter=active&templateURL=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fthethingsnetwork%2Fbuilds%2Fintegration-aws%2Fdist%2Fcloudformation.template&stackName=ttn-integration&param_AccountServer=https:%2F%2Faccount.thethingsnetwork.org&param_DiscoveryServer=discovery.thethings.network:1900&param_InstanceType=t2.micro&param_ThingShadowDeltaFPort=1&param_ThingSyncEnabled=true&param_ThingSyncInterval=10m&param_ThingTypeName=lorawan)

   * Enter a **Stack name**, for example `ttn-app`
   * Enter the **App ID** and an **App Access Key** of your application in The Things Network
   * Enter an **Environment Name** for Elastic Beanstalk, for example `ttn-app`
   * If you are using a private network, change the **Account Server** and **Discovery Server** to the endpoints of your private network
   * Select an existing EC2 KeyPair in **SSH Key** to access the EC2 instance. [Read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)

   > The **App Access Key** that you enter should at least have the `messages` and `devices` rights.

   Example parameters:

3. Review your settings and check the **I acknowledge** box to acknowledge that resources for the integration may be created in your AWS account
4. Click **Create** to initiate the creation of the stack
5. After a coffee break of about six minutes, you will see two new stacks:

    ![Stacks](stacks.png)

    > The `awseb-...` stack is an AWS Elastic Beanstalk stack that is created as part of the stack of the integration process.

ðŸŽ‰ You have now successfully configured the AWS IoT integration! See the guides on the left to learn working with the [thing registry](./thing-registry.md), [test messages](./test-messages.md), [thing shadows](./thing-shadows.md), [act on data](./act-on-data.md), [view metrics](./view-metrics.md) and [update](./update.md) the integration.
