[Go](https://golang.org) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

With our [Go SDK for Application Developers](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/go-app-sdk) you can receive activations and uplink messages from devices via The Things Network as well as respond with downlink messages. You can also use the SDK to manage devices.
