The HTTP Integration allows you to send uplink data to an endpoint and receive downlink data over HTTP.

## Uplink

You can configure the URL, the HTTP method (e.g. `POST`) and optionally the HTTP Authorization header of your endpoint but also a custom HTTP header of your choice.

The integration will post data in the following format:

```js
{
  "app_id": "my-app-id",              // Same as in the topic
  "dev_id": "my-dev-id",              // Same as in the topic
  "hardware_serial": "0102030405060708", // In case of LoRaWAN: the DevEUI
  "port": 1,                          // LoRaWAN FPort
  "counter": 2,                       // LoRaWAN frame counter
  "is_retry": false,                  // Is set to true if this message is a retry (you could also detect this from the counter)
  "confirmed": false,                 // Is set to true if this message was a confirmed message
  "payload_raw": "AQIDBA==",          // Base64 encoded payload: [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]
  "payload_fields": {},               // Object containing the results from the payload functions - left out when empty
  "metadata": {
    "time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",   // Time when the server received the message
    "frequency": 868.1,               // Frequency at which the message was sent
    "modulation": "LORA",             // Modulation that was used - LORA or FSK
    "data_rate": "SF7BW125",          // Data rate that was used - if LORA modulation
    "bit_rate": 50000,                // Bit rate that was used - if FSK modulation
    "coding_rate": "4/5",             // Coding rate that was used
    "gateways": [
      {
        "gtw_id": "ttn-herengracht-ams", // EUI of the gateway
        "timestamp": 12345,              // Timestamp when the gateway received the message
        "time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",  // Time when the gateway received the message - left out when gateway does not have synchronized time
        "channel": 0,                    // Channel where the gateway received the message
        "rssi": -25,                     // Signal strength of the received message
        "snr": 5,                        // Signal to noise ratio of the received message
        "rf_chain": 0,                   // RF chain where the gateway received the message
        "latitude": 52.1234,             // Latitude of the gateway reported in its status updates
        "longitude": 6.1234,             // Longitude of the gateway
        "altitude": 6                    // Altitude of the gateway
      },
      //...more if received by more gateways...
    ],
    "latitude": 52.2345,              // Latitude of the device
    "longitude": 6.2345,              // Longitude of the device
    "altitude": 2                     // Altitude of the device
  },
  "downlink_url": "https://integrations.thethingsnetwork.org/ttn-eu/api/v2/down/my-app-id/my-process-id?key=ttn-account-v2.secret"
}
```

_Note: Some values may be omitted if they are `null`, `false`, `""` or `0`._

## Downlink

Your application can schedule a downlink message to a URL for your application in a region, process name and app access key:

```
https://integrations.thethingsnetwork.org/ttn-eu/api/v2/down/my-app-id/my-process-id?key=ttn-account-v2.secret
```

This URL is also provided in each uplink message for convenience. However, you can call this URL any time to schedule a downlink. Note that `ttn-eu` refers to the region; other valid regions are `ttn-us-west`, `ttn-brazil` and `ttn-asia-se`.

Your application should `POST` or `PUT` a downlink message.

### With raw payload

You can schedule a message with raw payload using this format:

```js
{
  "dev_id": "my-dev-id",    // The device ID
  "port": 1,                // LoRaWAN FPort
  "confirmed": false,       // Whether the downlink should be confirmed by the device
  "payload_raw": "AQIDBA==" // Base64 encoded payload: [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]
}
```

### With payload fields

You can also use payload fields if your application has an encoder payload function declared to encode JSON to binary:

```js
{
  "dev_id": "my-dev-id", // The device ID
  "port": 1,             // LoRaWAN FPort
  "confirmed": false,    // Whether the downlink should be confirmed by the device
  "payload_fields": {    // The JSON object to be encoded by your encoder payload function
    "on": true,
    "color": "blue"
  }
}
```

### Downlink scheduling

By default, the downlink will _replace_ the currently scheduled downlink, if any. It is also possible to schedule the
downlink as the _first_ or _last_ item in the downlink queue.

```js
{
  "dev_id": "my-dev-id",
  "port": 1,
  "confirmed": false,
  // payload_raw or payload_fields
  "schedule": "replace"  // Allowed values: "replace" (default), "first", "last"
}
```
