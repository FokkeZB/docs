### Data API

The Data API allow you to receive events and messages from devices as well as send messages to devices.

You can work with the Data API using [SDKs]({{< relref "../sdks" >}}) or directly through [MQTT]({{< relref "../mqtt" >}}).

### Application Manager API

The Application Manager API lets you manage applications, gateways and devices.

You can work with the Application Manager API using [SDKs]({{< relref "../sdks" >}}) or directly through [HTTP]({{< relref "../manager/" >}}).
