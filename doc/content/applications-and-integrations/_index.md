## Applications

To establish the communication with a LoRaWAN device, you need to [add the device]({{< relref "../devices-and-gateways/adding-devices" >}}) within an application.

An application can be created via the <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/console/" target="_blank">Console</a> or via the <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/cli/" target="_blank">CLI</a>. You create an application in no-time by providing an **Application ID** and setting its **Owner**. <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/adding-applications/" target="_blank">See details about creating an application using the Console or commands for using the CLI</a>.

## Integrations

Within your application, you can also create integrations to help you with processing data and acting on it by triggering events. This way, you can implement a solution e.g. to monitor or visualize your sensor data using some cloud IoT platform, to schedule commands to be sent to your end device, etc. 

> Integrations are added within applications.

The Things Stack Community Edition offers a number of <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/" target="_blank">integrations</a>:

- <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/mqtt/" target="_blank">MQTT</a> - The Things Stack Community Edition exposes an MQTT Server, so you can use <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/mqtt-clients/" target="_blank">MQTT clients</a>  to subscribe to uplink messages coming from your device, or to publish downlink messages to be sent to your device.
- <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/" target="_blank">Webhooks</a> - The HTTP Webhooks feature allows to send application-related messages to specific HTTP(S) endpoints. You can even contribute to our <a href="https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-webhook-templates/" target="_blank">Webhook templates</a> open source repository if you want to add a new <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/webhook-templates/" target="_blank">Webhook integration template</a> by yourself. 
- <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/storage" target="_blank">Storage Integration</a> - Storage Integration allows you to store upstream messages in a persistent database, so you can retrieve them at a later time.
- <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/aws-iot/" target="_blank">AWS IoT</a> - The Things Stack Community Edition allows you to integrate with AWS IoT and publish application telemetry to the IoT Core endpoint.
- <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/reference/application-packages/lora-cloud-device-and-application-services/" target="_blank">LoRa Cloud</a> - LoRa Cloud integration takes advantage of the <a href="https://www.loracloud.com/documentation/device_management" target="_blank">Device & Application Services protocol</a> to allow you to manage common functionalities at the application layer and geolocation for modem-based devices.
