# Account Server

The Account Server manages the [ACL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list) for The Things Network. It closed-source. If you'd like to run the [open-source backend](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/ttn) you will need to provide an account server with the exact same [API](api.md).

This guide will inform you about the [access](authentication.md) and [use](api.md) the Account Server API.

The endpoint for The Things Network Account Servers is currently `https://preview.account.thethingsnetwork.org` but will change to `https://account.thethingsnetwork.org` once we go into production.
