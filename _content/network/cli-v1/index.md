# The Things Network CLI

> This guide is for version `v1-staging` of the CLI, which works with [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](staging.thethingsnetwork.org). Please migrate to version 2.x for [console.thethingsnetwork.org](console.thethingsnetwork.org) ASAP.

Your Applications and Devices can be managed via [The Things Network Dashboard](../console-v1/index.md), but you can also use the CLI, if you're into that kind of thing. ðŸ˜Ž

## Prerequisites

* An account on [account.thethingsnetwork.org](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org)
