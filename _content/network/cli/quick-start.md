# Quick Start

This document gives a quick introduction to `ttnctl`.

## Installation

You can download the latest version of `ttnctl` using the following links:

* [Mac (64 bit, zip)](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/ttnctl-darwin-amd64.zip)
* [Linux (64 bit, zip)](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/ttnctl-linux-amd64.zip)

* [Windows (32 bit, zip)](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/ttnctl-windows-386.exe.zip)

> _Downloads are also available as `.tar.gz` archives, just change the extension in the links above._

SHA256 checksums for the uncompressed binaries are listed in the [`checksums`](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/checksums) file.

The `checksums` file is signed using our GPG key with fingerprint `2F06 2CD1 5425 47AF 71BD  9B81 8FC5 CD2B 9DFB 1B4B`. 
The signature is stored as [`checksums.sig`](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/checksums).

We often update `ttnctl`, so re-download it once in a while.
