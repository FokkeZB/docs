# Quick Start

This document gives a quick introduction to `ttnctl`.

## Installation

1.  Download the latest version of `ttnctl` using the following links:

    * [Mac (64 bit, zip)](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/ttnctl-darwin-amd64.zip)
    * [Linux (64 bit, zip)](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/ttnctl-linux-amd64.zip)
    * [Linux (32 bit, zip)](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/ttnctl-linux-386.zip)
    * [Linux (arm, zip)](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/ttnctl-linux-arm.zip)
    * [Windows (64 bit, zip)](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/ttnctl-windows-amd64.exe.zip)
    * [Windows (32 bit, zip)](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/ttnctl-windows-386.exe.zip)

    > Downloads are also available as `.tar.gz` archives, just change the extension in the links above.

    SHA256 checksums for the uncompressed binaries are listed in the [`checksums`](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/checksums) file. The `checksums` file is signed using our GPG key with fingerprint `2F06 2CD1 5425 47AF 71BD  9B81 8FC5 CD2B 9DFB 1B4B`. The signature is stored as [`checksums.sig`](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/master/checksums).

2.  Decompress the file and make the executable globally available.
    
    On Mac and Linux create an alias or copy the executable as `ttnctl` to `/usr/local/bin` (use `⇧⌘G` in Mac OS Finder) or any other value that is in your path. Make it executable with `chmod +x ttnctl`. On Windows use any other folder you use for global executables and make sure that folder is part of your path.

## Updates

To update the CLI run [`ttnctl selfupdate`](api.md#ttnctl-selfupdate).

## Configuration

If you don't like the default configuration options of `ttnctl`, you can configure them with environment variables or with a [configuration file](configuration.md#configuration-file). In most cases the default options should be fine. Later in this guide we'll add our application ID to the config file to save us some typing.

## Register and Login

1. To register as a new user, use the command [`ttnctl user register`](api.md#ttnctl-user-register):

    ```bash
    ❯ ttnctl user register yourname your@email.org
    Password: <entering password>
    INFO Registered user
    ```

2. Now go to [account.thethingsnetwork.org](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/) and click [ttnctl access code](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/users/authorize?client_id=ttnctl&redirect_uri=/oauth/callback/ttnctl&response_type=code).

3. You now have 5 minutes to use this code to login with [`ttnctl user login`](api.md#ttnctl-user-login):

    ```bash
    ❯ ttnctl user login LzWtldT-VGvN56I3u3oJiU8apRJGaWJAJKbYvALJoP3
    Password: <enter password>
    INFO Successfully logged in as yourname (your@email.org)
    ```

## Application Management

Now create a new application with [`ttnctl applications add`](api.md#ttnctl-applications-add). In this example we will create an application with the ID `hello-world` and title `Hello World App`.

```bash
❯ ttnctl applications add hello-world "Hello World App"
  INFO Added Application
  INFO Selected Current Application
```

Show your applications with [`ttnctl applications list`](api.md#ttnctl-applications-list) command:

```bash
❯ ttnctl applications list
  INFO Found 1 application(s)
   ID           Description      EUIs  Access Keys  Collaborators
1  hello-world  Hello World App  1     1            1
```

After an application is created, you'll need to **register it** on a handler before you can start registering devices:

```bash
❯ ttnctl applications register
  INFO Discovering Handler...                   Handler=ttn-handler-eu
  INFO Connecting with Handler...               Handler=eu.thethings.network:1904
  INFO Registered application                   AppID=hello-world
```

> By default, your application is registered on the `ttn-handler-eu` handler. This means that every LoRaWAN packet will be transmitted to the `eu` region of The Things Network. You can indicate another handler with the `--handler-id` flag. To show the list of available handlers, you can use the `ttnctl discover handler` command.

## Selecting an application

The newly added application has been selected for further commands automatically. To select a different app call [`ttnctl applications select`](api.md#ttnctl-applications-select):

```bash
❯ ttnctl applications select
  INFO Found 2 applications:

  	ID                  	Description
1	hello-world        	Hello World App
2	bye-world        	Bye World App

Which one do you want to use?
Enter the number (1 - 2) > 2
  INFO Found one EUI "70B3D57EF000002E", selecting that one.
  INFO Updated configuration
```

> If you know the Application ID (and EUI), then you can also pass those as arguments. If only one application or EUI is available it will be selected automatically.

## Device Management

To register a device you can use the [`ttnctl devices register`](api.md#ttnctl-devices-register) command. In the following example we register a device with ID `my-device`. A Device EUI and AppKey will be generated by `ttnctl`:

```bash
❯ ttnctl devices register my-device
  INFO Using Application                        AppEUI=70B3D57EF000002E AppID=bye-world
  INFO Generating random DevEUI...
  INFO Generating random AppKey...
  INFO Discovering Handler...                   Handler=ttn-handler-eu
  INFO Connecting with Handler...               Handler=eu.thethings.network:1904
  INFO Registered device                        AppEUI=70B3D57EF000002E AppID=bye-world AppKey=2593946DADA09D86E36E4A4DD3AC632D DevEUI=00995D884BEBBAB9 DevID=my-device
```

To personalize a device for Activation-by-Personalization (ABP) we have the command [`ttnctl devices personalize`](api.md#ttnctl-devices-personalize). In the following example we personalize the just registered device. The AppSKey and NwkSKey will be generated by `ttnctl`:

```bash
❯ ttnctl devices personalize my-device
  INFO Using Application                        AppEUI=70B3D57EF000002E AppID=bye-world
  INFO Generating random NwkSKey...
  INFO Generating random AppSKey...
  INFO Discovering Handler...                   Handler=ttn-handler-eu
  INFO Connecting with Handler...               Handler=eu.thethings.network:1904
  INFO Requesting DevAddr for device...
  INFO Personalized device                      AppID=bye-world AppSKey=48F41F0491B23C804AEB9826162EB9AD DevAddr=160115EB DevID=my-device NwkSKey=D7A883537558946974B8DE31D4671617
```

You can see a list of registered devices with [`ttnctl devices list`](api.md#ttnctl-devices-list):

```bash
❯ ttnctl devices list
  INFO Using Application                        AppEUI=70B3D57EF000002E AppID=bye-world
  INFO Discovering Handler...                   Handler=ttn-handler-eu
  INFO Connecting with Handler...               Handler=eu.thethings.network:1904

DevID           	AppEUI          	DevEUI          	DevAddr
my-device       	70B3D57EF000002E	00995D884BEBBAB9	160115EB

  INFO Listed 1 device                          bye-world
```

You can also get information about a specific device with [`ttnctl devices info`](api.md#ttnctl-devices-info), for example for the personalized device:

```bash
❯ ttnctl devices info my-device
  INFO Using Application                        AppEUI=70B3D57EF000002E AppID=bye-world
  INFO Discovering Handler...                   Handler=ttn-handler-eu
  INFO Connecting with Handler...               Handler=eu.thethings.network:1904
  INFO Found device

  Application ID: bye-world
       Device ID: my-device
       Last Seen: never

    LoRaWAN Info:

     AppEUI: 70B3D57EF000002E
     DevEUI: 00995D884BEBBAB9
    DevAddr: 160115EB
     AppKey: <nil>
    AppSKey: 48F41F0491B23C804AEB9826162EB9AD
    NwkSKey: D7A883537558946974B8DE31D4671617
     FCntUp: 0
   FCntDown: 0
    Options: FCntCheckEnabled, 32BitFCnt
```

## Receiving Uplink Messages

The [`ttnctl subscribe`](api.md#ttnctl-subscribe) command subscribes to all uplink messages that are sent to your application:

```bash
❯ ttnctl subscribe
  INFO Connecting to MQTT...                    MQTT Broker=tcp://eu.thethings.network:1883 Username=fokkezb-playground
  INFO Connected to MQTT
  INFO Subscribed to activations
  INFO Subscribed to uplink
```

You can also subscribe to uplink messages using [MQTT](../../applications/mqtt/index.md).

## Scheduling Downlink Messages

Scheduling downlink messages is done with the [`ttnctl downlink`](api.md#ttnctl-downlink) command. In the following example we plan a downlink message of 3 bytes for the device we just registered:

```bash
❯ ttnctl downlink my-device 010203
  INFO Connecting to MQTT...                    MQTT Broker=tcp://eu.thethings.network:1883 Username=bye-world
  INFO Connected to MQTT
  INFO Enqueued downlink                        AppID=bye-world DevID=my-device
```

Or if you have configured an [encoder](api.md#ttnctl-applications-pf) for JSON payloads:

```bash
$ ttnctl downlink my-device --json '{"led":"on"}'
  INFO Connecting to MQTT...                    MQTT Broker=tcp://eu.thethings.network:1883 Username=bye-world
  INFO Connected to MQTT
  INFO Enqueued downlink                        AppID=bye-world DevID=my-device
```
