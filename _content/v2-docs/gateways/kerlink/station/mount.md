# Mount
The gateway comes standard with a mounting system which both supports a wall and pole mount option. 

It is recommended to mount the gateway outside as itâ€™ll improve the coverage. This should also be quite easy as the gateway is water proof and can have an offsite power supply dude to the PoE integration. 

## Flat surface

- The gateway can be mounted against a wall as show in the picture below
- The antenna can be mounted on the holder. This holder can be mounted on the gateway frame or the wall it self
