# Account Server

The Account Server manages the applications, gateways, users and rights for The Things Network. The current V2 Account Server is closed source and hosted at `https://account.thethingsnetwork.org`. The future V3 Identity Server will be open source.

This guide will inform you about the [access](./authentication.md) and [use](./api.md) the Account Server API. In order to use the API, you need to [request a client ID](./clientid.md).

If you'd like to run the [open source backend](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/ttn) you can use the community Account Server, or [implement your own](./implement.md).
