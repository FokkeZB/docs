# Node.js SDK

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript run-time built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

With the [Node.js Application SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttn) you can manage applications, receive uplink messages and send downlink messages. You can also use the SDK to manage devices.

*⚠️ The support and maintenance for this SDK has been discontinued, it is not recommended to use the SDK for new projects.*
