## Configuration

> What `clksrc` value should I use?

In the packet forwarder's configuration file, `clksrc` is the ID of the radio that provides clock to the concentrator. On most devices, it is the radio 1 - so the configuration should be `"clksrc": 1`. However, on the Multitech Conduit, the clock is provide by radio 0. Thus, if you're using a configuration that was not written for Multitech Conduits, you should ensure that in the configuration, `"clksrc": 0`.
