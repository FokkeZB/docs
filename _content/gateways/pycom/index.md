# Pygate description

Pygate is Pycom’s latest hardware tech portfolio addition.

This is a new super low-cost 8-channel LoRaWAN gateway that comes in the shape of a shield. It’s got the well-known form factor from our other shields and you can connect your much loved WiPy3, LoPy4 or a GPy to it. Hook in your Pycom development boards up and you have yourself a nifty little decentralized IoT network in one go. Pygate also fits inside the Universal IP67 Case so you don’t have to limit yourself to indoors.

Connect a WiPy3, LoPy4 or a GPy to this shield and then hook in all your other Pycom devices and you have yourself a nifty little decentralised IoT network in one go.
