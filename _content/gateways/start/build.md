# Build your own gateway

Building your own gateway is a fun and easy way to discover the LoRa world!

You will need:

+ A **LoRa concentrator board**, to receive LoRaWAN packets. The most common board used is the [iMST iC880a board](https://wireless-solutions.de/products/radiomodules/ic880a.html).
+ An **antenna**, to amplify the signal.
+ A **computer**, to process incoming and outcoming LoRaWAN packets, and to exchange them back and forth with the concentrator board. Many users use a [BeagleBone](http://beagleboard.org/bone), or a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org).

Wire them up together, and you can build your own gateway!

Our friends from the Zurich community put together [a guide](https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway/wiki) on how to build a gateway in a week-end with a Raspberry Pi and an iC880a concentrator board. In a matter of a few days, you should have a LoRaWAN gateway up and running on The Things Network!

Our lab pages contain a number of other [tutorials for building gateways](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/labs/stories/gateway) provided by our fantastic community.
