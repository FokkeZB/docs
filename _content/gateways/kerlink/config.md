# Configuration

## Configuring packet forwarder
To configure the gateway, you need to download [The Things Network's packet forwarder](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/kerlink-station-firmware/blob/master/dota/dota_thethingsnetwork_v1.3_EU.tar.gz) and [produsb.zip](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/kerlink-station-firmware/blob/master/dota/produsb.zip) from our Github.

Install the update the following way:

- Copy the content of [produsb.zip](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/kerlink-station-firmware/blob/master/dota/produsb.zip) and the [packet forwarder](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/kerlink-station-firmware/blob/master/dota/dota_thethingsnetwork_v1.3_EU.tar.gz) onto an empty USB flash drive formatted in FAT-32. Make sure there is no `.log` file.
- Plug the USB flash drive into the gateway.
- Wait for 5 min. During this time the gateway will reboot itself.
- Unplug the key and check that a `.log` file has appeared. The file should contain  `WirmaV2 0x080XXXXX updated`. This log file prevents any further installation on the gateways to avoid cyclic reboots.
- To redo the update on same gateway, remove this log file from the flash drive reinsert it into the gateway USB. This is not needed if you update another gateway.

## Connect with the Gateway

### SSH-Serial
Logon to the gateway by using the SSH protocol, on a Mac or Linux system just use the Terminal and `run ssh root@10.1.0.117` (substitute by the correct IP-address). On a Windows PC you can use [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). Login with the user `root` and default password `root`.

At your firewall system make sure the external IP-address used will map port `1700` to the internal IP-address of the gateway. This is needed when using NAT for internal IP-address translation.

Your are basically done now. For further checking continue to the next step. The following steps require some knowledge about how to use the command-line in Linux or Mac.

## WIRGRID
The serial interface (linux console) of the gateway can also be accessed by using the QIRGRID debug tool. This tool connect to your PC by a USB (type B > A) cable.

![WIRGRID](config-wirgrid.jpg)

1.	Connect the WIRGRID tool to your gateway and PC 
2.	Look up to which port the WIRGRID is assigned to
3.	Open a serial connection with the following settings:
    - **Baudrate:** 115200
    - **Data length:** 8
    - **Parity:** none
    - **Stop bit:** 1
    - **Flow control:** none
4. When the connection opens up, log in with the following credentials
    - **Login:** root
    - **Password:** root

## Check if the Packet forwarder is running

### The Packet Forwarder on gateway
Use the following command on the gateway to check whether data is being sent and received:

```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 -n -vvvX host 54.229.214.112
```

The output must be somewhat similar to the following, check out if inbound as well as outbound traffic is shown:

```plaintext

The gateway does not automatically send data to auto include itself on the status pages of The Things Network. This will only happen after a network node has sent or is sending data via the gateway.

### Packet forwarder status on TTN network with NOC

When the packet forwarder is running, it report to the TTN network. The activity of all the gateways on the network can be checked by the NOC tool. 

1.	Go to the [noc gateway overview](http://noc.thethingsnetwork.org:2020/api/v1/gateways)
2.	Look up your gateway EUI by using the find-tool (`Crtl/Cmd + F`)
3.	Youâ€™ll see the following information next to the EUI:

    ```json
    {"id":"eui-0000024b080602d9","status":{"lastSeen":"1479346682871027747"}}
    ```
    
4.	Last Seen determines when it was the last time the gateway was shown on the TTN network. The time unit is in UNIX-time, and can be converted by converter to the standard time unit.

### Packet forwarder status on TTN network simple overview

The activity of all the gateways on the network can also be checked at [https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/gatewaystatus/](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/gatewaystatus/).

This page is more simple than the raw data from option two. The only downside is that the page updates slightly slower that the previous option.
