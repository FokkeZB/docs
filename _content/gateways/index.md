# Gateways

Gateways form the bridge between devices and The Things Network. Devices use low power networks like LoRaWAN to connect to the Gateway, while the Gateway uses high bandwidth networks like WiFi, Ethernet or Cellular to connect to The Things Network.

All Gateways within reach of a device will receive its messages and forward them to The Things Network. The network will deduplicate the messages and select the best Gateway to forward any messages queued for the device. A single Gateway can serve thousands of devices.

## Help build a global network

No coverage where your device lives? Need more bandwidth? Simply add another Gateway to extend the network for both your own use and anyone else's.

We are getting ready to ship the affordable [The Things Gateway](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/419277966/the-things-network) before the end of this year. But you can use any standard LoRa gateway with The Things Network. Under **Hardware** you can find gateways that have been tested and documented by our users.
