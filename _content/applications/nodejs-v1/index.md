# Node.js SDKs

> This guide is for version 1.x of the SDK, which works with [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](staging.thethingsnetwork.org). Please migrate to version 2.x for [console.thethingsnetwork.org](console.thethingsnetwork.org) ASAP.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript run-time built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

With the [TTN Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttn) you can receive activations and uplink messages from devices via The Things Network as well as respond with downlink messages.

## Prerequisites

* Access to [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/).
* Access to an application with registered device on TTN.
* A server/computer to run Node.js on.
* Version 1.x of the [TTN Node.js client](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/node-app-lib).
