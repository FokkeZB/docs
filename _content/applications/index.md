# Applications

By *Applications*, we mean whatever it is your devices communicate with on the internet. This could be as simple as an [IFTTT Maker Applet](https://ifttt.com/maker) or a visual flow using [Node-RED](nodered/) to custom code on some server.

Before you can communicate with devices, you will need to add the application to the network and [register devices](../devices/registration.md) to it.

There are multiple [options](options.md) to integrate applications with The Things Network, ranging from working directly with APIs, via more friendly SDKs or click-and-run Platform Integrations.
