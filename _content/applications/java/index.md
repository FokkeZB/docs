# Java SDK

[Java](https://www.java.com) is a complete ecosystem that provides tools for developing software and deploying it in a cross-platform environment.

With the [TTN Client](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.thethingsnetwork/java-app-lib) you can receive activations and uplink messages from devices via The Things Network as well as respond with downlink messages.
