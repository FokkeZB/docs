# Node-RED

[Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) is a free, JavaScript-based server and web GUI for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services. You can find a lot of example flows and additional nodes in the [Node-RED Library](http://flows.nodered.org/).

With the [Node-RED node for TTN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ttn) it is very easy to process device messages and activations with pretty much no code.
