# Node-RED

> This guide is for version 0.x of the SDK, which works with [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](staging.thethingsnetwork.org). Please migrate to version 1.x for [console.thethingsnetwork.org](console.thethingsnetwork.org) ASAP.

[Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) is a free, JavaScript-based server and web GUI for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services.

With the [Node-RED node for TTN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ttn) it is very easy to process device messages and activations with pretty much no code.

## Prerequisites

* Access to [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/).
* Access to an application with registered device on TTN.
* A Node-RED instance or server/computer to install it on.
* Version 0.x of the [Node-RED node for TTN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ttn).
