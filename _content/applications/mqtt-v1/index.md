[MQTT](http://mqtt.org) is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

The Things Network uses MQTT to publish device activations and messages, but also allows you to publish a message for a specific device in response.

## Prerequisites

* Access to [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/).
* Access to an application with registered device on TTN.
