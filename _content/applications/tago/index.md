# Tago

In this article, you will be instructed on how to integrate TTN LoRaWANTM devices with [TagoIO](https://tago.io/). You will be able to send data from your devices (uplink) to TagoIO and back to them (downlink).


## 1. TagoIO Setup
After creating an account on [Tago.io](https://tago.io/), go to Devices, click on *'Add Devices'*, and filter by LoRaWAN TTN. Then, search for the device that you want to add. If you don't find it, select the type *Custom TTN Device*.

> When selecting Custom TTN Device connector, a payload parse will NOT included on the new device. You will need to add your own parser to extract values. 

Just give a name for the device, type the device EUI, and click on the **'Create Device'** button. 

For example, if you selected the 'Custom TTN' type, you will be presented with the following screen.

After the device is created, a standard parser script is included in the 'Payload Parser' tab based on the selected connector (unless you selected Custom TTN). Later, you can also add your own script to execute any calculation or to parse more data. 

Then, you need to **create an Authorization** and use it in the TTN setup later.

> This **Authorization** should be generated by TagoIO [here](https://admin.tago.io/devices/authorization); no Additional Parameters are needed

Copy this Authorization to use it in the next step.

## 2. TTN Setup

In The Things Network [Developer Console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/), go to your already created Application, select the 'Integrations' tab, and click **+add integration**.

Select **TagoIO** from the integration list.

Here you fill in your Process ID, your access key, and the paste **Authorization** created at TagoIO.

If you have followed all the steps, as soon as your devices start to send data to TTN, the data packages will be forwarded to your TagoIO account.


## Downlink

To send data back to your device, just go to your device at Tago and visit the tab **Configuration Parameters**.

Here you can add two parameters, for different data formats.

**payload_raw** 
Will send the raw payload to your device.

**payload_fields** 
The payload fields value needs to be a **valid JSON Object**, and Tago will send that object to your device.

You can choose between these two data formats, or you can send both.

When your data is sent to The Things Network and scheduled to send to your device, your parameter will be **marked as sent**, to **send it again**, mark the parameter as not sent.
