# Collos Integration

Collos offers a collection of location-ready APIs all allowing free prototyping with instant sign-up. What is more, within the Collos framework and market place it is easy to build on top of existing technology adding intelligence and learning to make new and powerful location services. Your new location service can be kept private or shared back to Collos for others to use. When sharing back to Collos, you set the price of using it â€“ it can even be free, if you choose.

Collos is now in preview. See [preview.collos.org](http://preview.collos.org) for more information and sign up.
