# Hello, World!

> The current beta boards come unconfigured, with no <em>Hello World</em>.

* Make sure you are within range of The Things Gateway or other LoRaWAN Gateway that is active on The Things Network.
* Use the included Micro-USB cable and any USB power adapter, powerbank or port to power up The Things Uno. The green LED should go on.
* Go to `[URL]` and enter the unique code printed on `[LOCATION]` of The Things Uno.
* Give it a minute and you should see your The Things Uno say *Hello*.

No success? Use the Arduino IDE [Serial Monitor](/arduino/#serial-monitor) to verify that the device works and can connect with The Things Network.
