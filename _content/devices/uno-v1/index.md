<a href="https://shop.thethingsnetwork.com/index.php/product/the-things-uno/" target="_blank">The Things Uno</a> is based off the [Arduino Leonardo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLeonardoMicro) ([not the Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLeonardoMicro#toc9)) with added [Microchip LoRaWAN module](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology). It is fully compatible with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and existing shields.

It's the perfect board to start prototyping your IoT ideas or make an existing project wireless with up to 10km range by simply swapping boards.
