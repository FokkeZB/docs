# Getting Started with LoRa

In this guide you will get to know LoRa and LoRaWAN and how it is commonly used. At the end we will discuss how The Things Network implements it and how to get started in using it.

We start with an expanation of the LoRa physical layer. Then we continue to the LoRaWAN protocol that sits on top of this physical layer. After this we continue with an explanation of the key components of a LoRaWAN network. At the end we look at the LoRa alliance, followed by an expanation of what The Things Network offers.
